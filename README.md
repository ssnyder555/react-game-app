## This is my DiskGolf-App!

In the project directory, you can run:
 - Golfer uses google maps to find where the nearest parks are.

- Golfer sets up course details:
- number of holes in course
- Disk Throws per hole
-- at the end of the 18(or whatever) holes a print of how many throws were thrown. *Modal - if you won or lost.
